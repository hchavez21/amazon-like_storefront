#If the client chooses a quantity that is available it will tally up the total for the items and display it.

#The application will prompt the questions again starting the app back again.

#The database will be updating unless there has been an insufficient quantity.



#This is a short video showing the functionality of this application along with a view of the change in the mysql database.
